# Zoiex Technologies test task solution

**Demo link: [DEMO](https://dmytro-matsehora.github.io/Zoiex/)**

The project is implemented on the basis of **Vue.js 3 + Vuetify 3 + Vite**. <br/>
Language: **TypeScript**.

- The application loads GIFs on the page using the giphy.com **API**.
- **Infinite scrolling** is implemented (by default + 20 pictures are loaded each time).
- The **search bar** looks for GIFs in the database, works dynamically, without pressing Enter.
- If not one gif is found, a random gif **"Not Found"** is shown.
- The application is fully adapted to the mobile device (**PWA**).
- Clicking on a GIF opens a **GIF Card** page with the original size and information about the GIF.
- If the gif was added by the user, you can go to his page **User Card**, with the ability to go back.

## Setup

## P.S.
*It was a very interesting and valuable experience with Vue for me, I am glad that I managed to complete this task. <br>
Of course, there is still a lot to improve, but I hope that I have implemented the main functionality correctly. I will be glad to feedback, comments and advice, it helps me to become better.*

**Thank you for your attention and may the force be with you!ðŸŒŒ**
